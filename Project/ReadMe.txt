(1) ForceVsSubstrate.m
This file contains the code that can be used to plot the variation of mean retrograde flow and mean traction force as a function of substrate stiffness.

(2) Viscoelastic.m
This file contains the code that can be used to plot the variation of mean retrograde flow and mean traction force as a function of substrate viscosity.

(3) VincullinEffect.m
This file contains the code that can be used to plot the effect of vinculin in mean traction force and mean retrograde flow.

(4) DiffK_subValue.m
This file contains the code to study the effects of varying viscosity combined with different values of elasticity on mean traction force and mean retrograde flow.
